# HOPES

## What is HOPES?

**HOPES** (HVAC Off-Policy Evaluation) is a Python package for evaluating and selecting RL-based HVAC
control policies. It offers a set of estimators and tools to evaluate the performance of a target policy,
compared to a set of baseline policies (characterized by an offline logged dataset), using off-policy evaluation
techniques.
