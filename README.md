## What is HOPES?

**HOPES** (HVAC Off-Policy Evaluation) is a Python package for evaluating and selecting RL-based HVAC 
control policies. It offers a set of estimators and tools to evaluate the performance of a target policy, 
compared to a set of baseline policies (characterized by an offline logged dataset), using off-policy evaluation 
techniques.
